## ðŸš€ Introduction
This project was developed as part of the challenge proposed in the "UX Designer Training" course at DIO.
The goal was to apply the concepts and principles of User Experience learned so far, consolidating the fundamentals of UX.
For this purpose was created a: Medium Fidelity Wireframe for Clothing E-commerce.

## ðŸ’» Project

I have chosen to design the layout of the homepage for a clothing e-commerce website, focusing on the mobile version.
The layout structure was conceived to facilitate navigation and product discovery, while offering account management functionalities and interaction with the store.

## ðŸ”– Layout

- Top Navigation: spaces dedicated to navigation, product search, and checkout.
- Center Layout, organized vertically into three distinct groups, each group offers interaction and navigation functionalities for specific areas and products:
  - a. Store Billboard.
  - b. Featured Deals.
  - c. Coming Soon.
- Footer: account management functionalities and interaction with the store.

## ðŸ”§ Wireframe
The medium fidelity wireframe was developed in Figma, striking a balance between visual details and simplicity to allow a clear understanding of the structure and functionalities.
