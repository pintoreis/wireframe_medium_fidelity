Each group offers interaction and navigation functionalities for specific areas and products.
Footer:
Account management functionalities and interaction with the store.
Wireframe Presentation:
The medium fidelity wireframe was developed in Figma, striking a balance between visual details and simplicity to allow a clear understanding of the structure and functionalities.
